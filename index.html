        <h2 class="seched"><strong>Adventure Time!</strong></h2>
        <p class="text">
                An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky.[1] Adventures may be activities with
          danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
          scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are
          often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to
          achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only
          be obtained by such activities.
          <br /><br />
          Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the
          purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing
          and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains
          in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers â€“ the
          British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw
          global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental
          constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure
          education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.

        <h2 class="des">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over
            rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes.
            Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate
            features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough
            terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger
            and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically
            or hydraulically actuated disc brakes.
  
            <br /><br />
            This sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike
            handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep
            technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of freeride,
            downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both
            natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps.[2]
            Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack,
            back-country roads, wider bike park trails, fire roads, and some
            advanced trails are designed with jumps, berms, and drop-offs to add
            excitement to the trail.

            <h2 class="des"><strong>PARA-GLIDING</strong></h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
                flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
                aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
                harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric
                wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure
                of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
                forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br /><br />
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
                and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two
                hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
                skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
                often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="des"><strong>SURFING</strong></h2>
                </div>
                <p class="text">
                    Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
                    two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
                    or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
                    towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
                    ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
                    ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
                    pools.
                    <br /><br />
                    The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board,
                    regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche
                    of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
                    the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
                    Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
                    modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding
                    a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
                    surfing.
